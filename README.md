figuring out github

I'm here to build Data visualizations, forecasts, etc. using R. I'm particularly interested in MLB data/statcast/etc.

ideas:

-individual batter/pitcher tendencies (count/pitch/zone/pitch velocity/result) vs righty/lefty. Create a tool

-plot a hitter's swing rate/chase rate over time.  Do pitchers adjust to hitter tendencies? Is it the other way around? how quickly are adjustments made?
